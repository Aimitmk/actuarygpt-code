Code is not provided as the full code is verbose and not all of it is relevant to the paper (particularly the detailed API calls and frontend JavaScript code).

However, creating such a knowledgebase has become significantly easier thanks to open-source contributions. We direct the reader to the [Vault-AI](https://github.com/pashpashpash/vault-ai) GitHub repository which provides a near full solution to the problem. One needs only to upload their required documents and provide the needed API keys.
